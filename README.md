# IS211_Final_Project

Hello and welcome to my final project for IS211!

For the final project, I opted to build a basic book catalogue app and include two additional extra credit stretch goals, support for searching by title in addition to ISBN and multi-user support. The SQLite3 database file, books.db, has a schema created by the script app_db.py. It is a simple database with only two tables: users and books. I pre-populated the users table with two users, user1 and user2, and set their passwords to "password1" and "password2". Adding another user is as simple as adding another row in the table. The books table contains all the needed values for each book - title, authors, page count, and average rating - as well as a foreign key tied to the users table to identify which user owns the title.

The app itself begins with the requisite imports, including requests, which I chose to parse the Google API calls based on its built-in JSON handling functions. I also imported re to set up ISBN matching later in the app. I set up database handling, bookended by the get_db() and close_connection() functions at the beginning and end of the app. A standard login page follows, with a call to match the login credentials with the contents of the users table of the database. If login is successful, the user moves on to the dashboard; otherwise, they see an error.

dashboard.html is the largest component of the app - I wanted to keep the forms to add and delete to and from the catalogue on the same page as the catalogue's display to streamline functionality, in lieu of separate pages for addition and deletion. After establishing that the user is properly logged in, the dashboard pulls the username from the session key and uses a databse call to find the user's user id, which it then plugs in to pull up that user's books and display them neatly in a table. The "submit" route checks whether the form item submitted is an ISBN or a title using the regex variable set earlier in the program, and then searches based on either title or ISBN accordingly. requests's built-in JSON handling extracts the needed info for each book and I set up try/except clauses in case any data is missing. Deletion works by title and user id so titles owned by other users don't get accidentally deleted. Both routes trigger a refresh of the dashboard so users can see changes immediately.

I tried to keep the app as simple and straightforward as possible. This has been an excellent introdution to web development and I feel much more confident in my skills as I continue to learn more about the subject. Thank you for this semester!
